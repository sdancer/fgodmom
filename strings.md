EARNING EXTRA LIVES"    Every^time^you^are^nabbed^by^a&crab,^sealed^in^a^wall^or^caught^in^an"implosion,^you^lose^a^life.^^There are,^however,^ways^to^earn^extra#lives.^^You^earn^an^extra^life^each&time^you^finish^a^level.^^You^can^also"earn^extra^lives^by^collecting^the"gold^coins^marked^with^wand^stars."These^bonuses^appear^when^you^have#collected^the^seven^pennies.^^Every&gold^coin^you^have^when^you^finish^the
level is worth one extra life.U
IMPLOSIONS%    Sometimes,^objects^disappear^in^a%flash.^^This^happens^when^two^objects"try^to^occupy^the^same^space.^^For"example,^if^you^try^to^transform^a
crab^to^a^penny^while^the^crab$overlaps^a^ladder,^there^will^be^two$objects^in^the^same^space^(where^the&objects^overlap).^^Because^two^objects$cannot^exist^in^the^same^space,^This&overlap^causes^a^small^tear^in^reality#(trust^me),^and^some^objects^may^be%sucked^away^(an^implosion).^^The^best$way^to^see^what^an^implosion^does^is#to^create^one.^^An^implosion^is^not&dangerous,^unless^you^are^close^enough
to get pulled in.U
	THE CRABS$    As^you^make^your^way^through^the%levels,^you^must^be^careful^not^to^be#    caught^by^the^crabs.^^The^three$    crabs^are^very^stupid^and^cannot"    run^faster^than^you.^^However,"    they^just^have^to^touch^you^to

IMPORTANT!#    Note:^The^wand^does^not^work^on&objects^made^of^iron.^^You^can^neither"scan^nor^project^the^pattern^of^an

 USING THE MAGIC WAND (CONTINUED)&    For^example:^To^change^a^crab^to^a%wooden^ladder,^you^would^first^scan^a

USING THE MAGIC WAND!    Your^only^weapon^is^a^wand^of%transformation.^^This^wand^allows^you&to^transform^objects^for^five^seconds.&First,^you^must^scan^the^pattern^of^an#object^(like^taking^its^picture)^by%pressing^the^<B>^key^(or^any^key^from&the^bottom^row).^^The^pattern^you^have%scanned^will^then^appear^in^your^WAND PATTERN^box^at^the^bottom^of^the$screen^to^show^you^what^pattern^your$wand^contains.^^You^can^project^that&pattern^onto^other^objects^by^pressing$the^space^bar.^^A^transformed^object$will^stay^that^way^for^five^seconds.&At^the^end^of^five^seconds,^the^object
will go back to normal.U
THE OBJECT OF F.GODMOM     The^object^of^F.Godmom^is^to"complete^all^fifty^levels^and^free!your^fellow^fairy^godmothers.^^To
finish^each^level,^you^must
collect^seven^pennies^while!avoiding^the^killer^crabs.^^After%    you^have^collected^seven^pennies,#    the^magic^exit^door^will^appear"    (unless^the^space^in^which^the%    exit^door^is^to^appear^is^blocked"by^another^object).^^You^also^need
to^retrieve^a^magic^key^to^open"the^exit^door.^^Once^you^reach^the!exit^door,^the^level^is^complete,"and you move on to the next level.U
THE STORY SO FAR...$    Fifty^members^of^the^elite^Fairy$Godmothers'^Corps^have^been^captured%in^an^insidious^dimensional^trap,^and%the^director^of^the^Corps^has^decided$    that^you^are^their^best^hope^for!    freedom.^^To^free^your^fellow&    Corps^members,^you^must^unlock^the"    dimensional^trap^by^collecting$seven^magic^coins^from^each^of^fifty%levels.^^Armed^only^with^a^magic^wand%of^transformation,^you^must^make^your&way^across^fifty^levels^while^avoiding&killer^crabs^and^dangerous^dimensional!implosions.^^If^you^succeed,^your%fellow^Godmoms^will^be^freed^and^will

 to other people.  If you own a modem, feel free to upload the game 
 to the bulletin boards you use.  (Please upload it as the file     
!FG40!.ZIP=, so people know it is the latest version.)  Or, leave a 
 message to all the other BBS users, telling them how much you like 
 the game.  But even if you just give copies of F.Godmom to your    
 friends, I will be happy.  And hopefully, the people you give copies
 of F.Godmom to will also be happy.  Thanks!    --
